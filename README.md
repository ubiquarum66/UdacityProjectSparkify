### Report and Homework Project Capstone 

1. Installations

The jupyter notebook for Project Capstone is called 

~~~~
AWS_Sparkify_Model_And_Fit.ipynb.ipynb
Sparkify_ceck_features.ipynb
UDACITY_Sparkify_model_and_fit.ipynb
~~~~

The check_features notebook does some data exploration and plotting for the mini dataset.


Due to the non interactive run on the AWS cluster, pictures and data exploring is done in an extra notebook, that has to be run in the Udacity workspace with the small excerpt database.

The two others were thought to be one, but AWS and UDACITY workspace differ in that AWS does not offer a pandas module (???)

Thus, the AWS module can be run only with a restricted feature set, usable without using pandas commands.

Up to now I have no solution path, so I will submit the project in the Udacity variant.
and demonstrate principal functionality in the AWS env with reduced feature set.

Pyspark and pandas, numpy are installed in the Udacity world.


2. Project Motivation

The Notebook represents the Capstone Project of Data Science Nanodegree Course Term 2. It's output and interpretation can be found at [my GitHub Blog Page](https://ubiquarum66.github.io/).

4. How to Interact with this project

start notebook with 'jupyter notebook' command in a environment supporting pyspark and python 3, in the same directory where all these files are collected, and access the mini data set or the s3n:// big
dataset in the amazon world.

The Feature check script is only running in the Udacity workspace. It was made during feature 
search to deliver pictures and numbers..

5. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.

For establishing the Github Blog Post, I have to thank Barry Clark for his Jekyll Now explanations and templates.
Google and Stackoverflow -- as usual -- helped enormeosly to find -- for me -- tricky Python hacks.

The AWS reinbursement did not work so far, but I am on it.

Again, I learned tons, and that's the main purpose.
