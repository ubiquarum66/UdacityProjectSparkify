### Report and Homework Project 1

1. Installations

The jupyter notebook for Project 1 is called UdacityCapstoneNotebook.ipynb.

It is tested to run with Python 3 in an AWS installation environment.

Pyspark and pandas, numpy are installed there.


Due to the non interactive run on the AWS cluster, pictures and data exploring is done in an extra notebook, that has to be run in the Udacity workspace with the small excerpt database.

This File is called UdacityCapstoneNotebook_Explore.ipynb.

Only there pictures are shown wizh jupyter inline matplotlib.


2. Project Motivation

The Notebook represents the Capstone Project 5  of Data Science Nanodegree Course. It's output and interpretation can be found at [my GitHub Blog Page](https://ubiquarum66.github.io/).
